### Creating objects in R

(weight_kg <- 55)
weight_kg

2.2 * weight_kg

weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg

weight_kg <- 100
weight_lb

### Challenge
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.0
age <- age - 20
mass_index <- mass/age
mass_index

### Vectors and data types

weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g

animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals

length(weight_g)
length(animals)

class(weight_g)
class(animals)

str(weight_g)
str(animals)

weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90)
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g)

## ## Weâ€™ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric, integer, and
## ## logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single
## ## vector?
## 
## ## What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to
## ## check the data type of your object)
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, 'a')
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c('a', 'b', 'c', TRUE)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, '4')


## 
## ## Why do you think it happens?
## 
## ## Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of the data
## ## types?


### Subsetting

animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]

weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 50)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]

weight_g > 50
weight_g[weight_g >= 50]

# OR |
weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g >= 50]

# AND: &
weight_g[weight_g > 30 & weight_g == 21]

# NOT: !
weight_g[! (weight_g > 30 & weight_g == 21)]

animals[animals == "rat" | animals == "cat"]

animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "duck")]

# * Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` 
# returns `TRUE`?
# because it uses the alphabetical order

### Missing data

planets <- c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth",
             "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn",
             "Uranus", "Neptune", NA)

heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm=TRUE)
max(heights)
max(heights, na.rm=TRUE)

mean(na.omit(heights))

heights[!is.na(heights)]

### Challenge

## Why does the following piece of code
## give an error message?
vec <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(vec, na.rm=TRUE)

## Why does the error message say the argument
## is not "numeric"?

mean(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE))
mean(heights >= 4, na.rm=TRUE)
sum(heights >= 4, na.rm=TRUE)

### Presentation of the survey data
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
             "data/portal_data_joined.csv")

surveys <- read.csv(file="data/portal_data_joined.csv")

head(surveys)
tail(surveys)

str(surveys)

## Challenge
## Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?
## * What is the class of the object `surveys`?
#     It's a data frame
## * How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
#     13 columns and 34706 row
## * How many species have been recorded during these surveys?
#     48

### Factors
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)

food <- factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
food <- factor(food, levels=c("low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
min(food) ## doesn't work
food <- factor(food, levels=c("low", "medium", "high"), ordered=TRUE)
levels(food)
min(food) ## works!

f <- factor(c(1, 5, 10, 2))
as.numeric(f)               ## wrong! and there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(f)) ## works...
as.numeric(levels(f))[f]    ## The recommended way.

## Challenge
##
## * In which order are the treatments listed?
##
## * How can you recreate this plot with "control" listed
## last instead of first?
exprmt <- factor(c("treat1", "treat2", "treat1", "treat3", "treat1", "control",
                   "treat1", "treat2", "treat3"),
                 levels=c("treat1", "treat2",
                          "treat3", "control"))
table(exprmt)
barplot(table(exprmt))


## The data.frame class
## Compare the output of these examples, and compare the difference between when
## the data are being read as `character`, and when they are being read as
## `factor`.
example_data <- data.frame(animal=c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
                           feel=c("furry", "furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
                           weight=c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8))
str(example_data)
example_data <- data.frame(animal=c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
                           feel=c("furry", "furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
                           weight=c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8),
                           stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(example_data)

## ## Challenge
## ##  There are a few mistakes in this hand crafted `data.frame`,
## ##  can you spot and fix them? Don't hesitate to experiment!
author_book <- data.frame(author_first=c("Charles", "Ernst", "Theodosius"),
                          author_last=c("Darwin", "Mayr", "Dobzhansky"),
                          year=c(NA, 1942, 1970))
## ## Challenge:
## ##   Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following
## ##   example?
## ##   Check your guesses using `str(country_climate)`:
## ##   * Are they what you expected? Why? why not?
## ##   * What would have been different if we had added `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`
## ##     to this call?
## ##   * What would you need to change to ensure that each column had the
## ##     accurate data type?
country_climate <- data.frame(country=c("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),
                              climate=c("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),
                              temperature=c(10, 30, 18, 15),
                              northern_hemisphere=c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),

## Sequences and Subsetting data frames

### 1. The function `nrow()` on a `data.frame` returns the number of
### rows. Use it, in conjuction with `seq()` to create a new
### `data.frame` called `surveys_by_10` that includes every 10th row
### of the survey data frame starting at row 10 (10, 20, 30, ...)
###
### 2. Create a data.frame containing only the observation from 1999 of the -->
### surveys dataset.


### aggregating and analyzing data with dplyr
surveys <- read.csv(file="data/portal_data_joined.csv")

library(dplyr)

## select some columns
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)

## filter some rows
filter(surveys, year == 1995)

## pipes

surveys %>% 
  filter(year == 1995) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight, year) %>% 
  head()

### Challenge
## Using pipes, subset the data to include individuals
## weighting more than 15g, collected before 1993, and
## show only the columns years, sex, and weight

surveys %>% 
  filter(weight > 15, year < 1993) %>% 
  select(sex, weight, year) %>% 
  nrow

nrow(
  select(
     filter(surveys, weight > 15, year > 1993),
     sex, weight, year
  )
)

## information about data frame
str(surveys)
dim(surveys)
nrow(surveys)
ncol(surveys)
names(surveys)

## Mutate
surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) 

### Challenge
## Create a new data frame from the survey data set that meet
## the following criteria:
## - it contains only the species_id column and a new column
##   called "hindfoot_half" that is half the value of the 
##   hindfoot_length column
## - there is no missing values in the hindfoot_half column
## - all the values are below 30

surveys_hf_below30 <- surveys %>% 
  mutate(hindfoot_half = hindfoot_length/2) %>% 
  filter(! is.na(hindfoot_length), hindfoot_half < 30) %>% 
  select(species_id, hindfoot_half)

write.csv(surveys_hf_below30,
          file="data_output/surveys_hf_below30.csv",
          row.names=FALSE)

## Split-apply-combine

surveys %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  tally

surveys %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm=TRUE)
  )

surveys %>% 
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm=TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(!is.nan(mean_weight),
         sex != "")

### Challenges

## 1. How many times each 'plot_type' has been surveyed?
surveys %>% 
  group_by(plot_type) %>% 
  tally

## 2. Use group_by and summarize to find the mean, min, maximum
##    for the hindfoot_length of each species
surveys %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_hindfoot_length=mean(hindfoot_length, na.rm=TRUE),
    min_hindfoot_length=min(hindfoot_length, na.rm=TRUE),
    max_hindfoot_length=max(hindfoot_length, na.rm=TRUE)
  )


## 3. [optional] What was the heaviest animal measured in each
##    year? (return the columns year, genus, species, and weight)

surveys %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(weight == max(weight, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  select(year, genus, species, weight)

## Plotting

library(ggplot2)

surveys_complete <- surveys %>% 
  filter(species_id != "",
         !is.na(weight),
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),

frequent_species <- species_count %>% 
  filter(n >= 10) %>% 
  select(species_id)

surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>% 
  filter(species_id %in% frequent_species$species_id)

ggplot(data = surveys_complete,
       aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color="blue")

ggplot(data = surveys_complete,
       aes(x = species_id, y=hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(color="tomato", alpha=0.3,

           group = sex,
           color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species_id)

## Challenge
## Plot how the average weight of each species
##  changes through the course of the experiment.
## Draw one line for males, and one line for females
         
surveys_complete %>% 
  group_by(species_id, year, sex) %>%
